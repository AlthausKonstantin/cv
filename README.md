# CV

This repository contains my curriculum vitae.  
The CV's data is stored in [yaml files](/data/), the content is then written into LaTeX source code and finally compiled into a PDF directly here on GitHub.  
The current version is attached to the latest [release](https://github.com/AlthausKonstantin/cv/releases).  
Note that there are two versions, one is a redacted version guarding my and other people's personal data (the .pdf file).
A full version is also attached but encrypted (the .pdf.age file).

# Credits
I use several public sources in this project. A big thanks to all of the developers who make this project possible!
- [The AltaCV LaTeX template](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) and [its fork by NicolasOmar](https://github.com/NicolasOmar/AltaCV).
- The encryption software [age by FiloSottile](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) and the secret manager [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops).
- Also a shoutout to [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com); without them and their support for open-source projects the automatic compilation right here would not be possible.
